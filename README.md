# RevolutionB - Bitcoin Manifesto





## Plight

&nbsp;

Our world is broken. Every day our rights are eroded, our reality distorted and our hope stamped out. We are slaves to the system.

&nbsp;

All over the world, people suffer a weak and predatory financial system that is controlled by those that do not care about us. Billions of people do not have access to the global economy and are locked into a life of hardship and struggle.

&nbsp;

The bankers, the elites, and those that seek to control us will not give up their power freely, but they are terrified of change. They will fight it to the end.

&nbsp;

The winds of change are coming though. You've felt them already. You've seen them in the news or overheard it in discussions by your friends family and colleagues. You've heard the whispers of a mysterious new thing...Bitcoin.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Revolution

&nbsp;

The internet has connected the whole world yet it has yet to set people free from their economic shackles. There is a missing piece to solve this puzzle, and that is Bitcoin.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin will tear down this broken and unfair system and replace it with a system where everyone is truly connected and free. Bitcoin provides economic freedom to anyone that participates in it.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin offers anyone the opportunity to change the world, and the ability to opt out of the current system.

&nbsp;

We are on the cusp of a revolution that will change humanity's path forever, and we need YOU to be a part of it with us.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Code

&nbsp;

- Bitcoin is a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.
- Bitcoin is for everyone.
- Bitcoin is permissionless.
- Bitcoin is usable by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
- We support voluntary participation in the economy.
- We are against censorship in all forms.

- We are against social manipulation.
- We are against the use of state force to control or influence the system.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Vision

&nbsp;

We imagine a world where people are no longer slaves to the machine. A world in which every single person is connected to the global economy and is free to choose their own destiny.

&nbsp;

In this world, no one can take your money from you, not even your government. In this world, you are free to participate in the economy however you see fit.

&nbsp;

In this world, no one is excluded.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Solution

&nbsp;

Bitcoin is the solution. Using any mobile device you are connected to this new global economy. You can pay, earn, spend, sell, share, save, donate, all at the click of a button and no one can stop you. Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank, your own taxman, your own master.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin is not communist or capitalist, it is something new and powerful. Bitcoin is voluntaryism. Bitcoin is freedom. Bitcoin is hope.

&nbsp;

Unite with us in the Bitcoin revolution.
